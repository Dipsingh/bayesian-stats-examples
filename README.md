# bayesian-stats-examples

Python versions of things taught in the Bayesian Statistics courses on Coursera.

* [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics) - taught by Herbert Lee from the University of California, Santa Cruz.
* [Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mcmc-bayesian-statistics) - taught by Matthew Heiner, also from University of California, Santa Cruz.

## Python packages used

* numpy
* scipy (for scipy.stats)
* statsmodels
* PyMC3
* matplotlib

## General impressions

* Course uses JAGS, PyMC3 has more natural syntax 
* statsmodels.OLS is not as flexible compared to R's lm().

## Caution

* Meant for understanding how to apply Python libraries to problems solved with R in the course.
* If used to answer quizzes, can lead to disappointment since answers don't always match exactly.
